## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed a non-essential automatic test that probably
  due to some RNG configuration failed when built on 
  x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) for R Under development.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 R installation, R 4.0.2
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

## Downstream dependencies
