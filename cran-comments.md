## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Made print output more compact.
* Removed confusing statistics without interpretative value.
* Removed `type = cairo` from vignette (as requested) since Cairo-based devices are not always available.
* Fixed bug that made power calculators for test of deficits behave unexpectedly.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 R installation, R 4.0.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.3

## R CMD check results
