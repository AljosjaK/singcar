\usage{
BTD(
  case,
  controls,
  sd = NULL,
  sample_size = NULL,
  alternative = c("less", "greater", "two.sided"),
  int_level = 0.95,
  iter = 10000,
  na.rm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{case}{Case observation, can only be a single value.}

\item{controls}{Numeric vector of observations from the control sample. If
single value, treated as mean.}

\item{sd}{If input of controls is single value, the standard
deviation of the sample must be given as well.}

\item{sample_size}{If input of controls is single value, the size of the
sample must be given as well.}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
must be one of \code{"less"} (default), \code{"greater"} or
\code{"two.sided"}. You can specify just the initial letter.}

\item{int_level}{Level of confidence for credible intervals.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations. Set to higher for more accuracy, set to
lower for faster calculations.}

\item{na.rm}{Remove \code{NA}s from controls.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"htest"} containing the following components:
\tabular{llll}{
\code{statistic}   \tab the value of the t-statistic.\cr\cr  \code{parameter}
\tab the degrees of freedom for the t-statistic.\cr\cr \code{p.value}    \tab
the p-value for the test.\cr\cr \code{estimate}    \tab estimated
standardised difference (zcc) and point estimate of p-value. \cr\cr
\code{null.value}   \tab the value of the difference under the null
hypothesis.\cr\cr \code{interval}     \tab named numerical vector containing
credibility level and intervals for both zcc and estimated proportion. \cr\cr
\code{desc}     \tab named numerical containing descriptive statistics: mean
and standard deviations of controls as well as sample size.
 \cr\cr \code{alternative}     \tab a character string
describing the alternative hypothesis.\cr\cr \code{method} \tab a character
string indicating what type of test was performed.\cr\cr \code{data.name}
\tab a character string giving the name(s) of the data as well as sum
summaries. }
}
\description{
Takes a single observation and compares it to a distribution estimated by a
control sample using Bayesian methodology. Calculates standardised difference
between the case score and the mean of the controls and proportions falling
above or below the case score, as well as associated credible intervals.
}
\details{
Returns the point estimate of the standardised difference
between the case score and the mean of the controls and the point estimate
of the p-value (i.e. the percentage of the population that would be
expected to obtain a lower or higher score, depending on the alternative
hypothesis).

BTD(case = size_weight_illusion[1, "V_SWI"],
    controls = size_weight_illusion[-1, "V_SWI"], alternative = "l", iter = 1000)
