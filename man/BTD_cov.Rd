\usage{
BTD_cov(
  case_task,
  case_covar,
  control_task,
  control_covar,
  alternative = c("less", "two.sided", "greater"),
  int.level = 0.95,
  iter = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{case_task}{The case score from the task of interest. Can only be of
length 1.}

\item{case_covar}{A vector containing the case scores on all covariates
included. Can be of any length except 0, in that case use
\code{\link{BTD}}.}

\item{control_task}{A vector containing the scores from the controls on the
task of interest.}

\item{control_covar}{A vector, matrix or dataframe cointaining the control
scores on the covariates included. If matrix or dataframe each column
represents a covariate.}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
must be one of \code{"two.sided"} (default), \code{"greater"} or
\code{"less"}. You can specify just the initial letter.}

\item{int.level}{The probability level on the Bayesian credible intervals.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations to be performed. Greater number gives better
estimation but takes longer to calculate.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"htest"} containing the following components:
  \tabular{llll}{ \code{statistic}   \tab the average z-value over
  \code{iter} number of iterations. \cr\cr \code{p.value}    \tab the average
  p-value over \code{iter} number of iterations. \cr\cr \code{estimate} \tab
  case scores expressed as z-scores on task X and Y. Standardised effect size
  (Z-CCC) of task difference between case and controls and point estimate of
  the proportion of the control population estimated to show a more extreme
  task difference. \cr\cr  \code{null.value}   \tab the value of the
  difference between tasks under the null hypothesis.\cr\cr \code{interval}
  \tab named numerical vector containing level of confidence and confidence
  intervals for both effect size and p-value.\cr\cr \code{desc}     \tab data
  frame containing means and standard deviations for controls as well as case
  scores. \cr\cr \code{cor.mat} \tab matrix giving the correlations between
  the task of interest and the covariates included. \cr\cr \code{sample.size}
  \tab number of controls..\cr\cr \code{alternative}     \tab a character
  string describing the alternative hypothesis.\cr\cr \code{method} \tab a
  character string indicating what type of test was performed.\cr\cr
  \code{data.name} \tab a character string giving the name(s) of the data}
