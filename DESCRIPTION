Description: When comparing single cases to control populations and no parameters
    are known researchers must estimate these with a control sample. This is often
    done when testing a case's abnormality on some variable or testing the discrepancy
    between two variables. The hitherto most appropriate methods for controlling Type I
    errors for such tests are implemented in this package, along with respective power 
    calculators as well as methods allowing for the inclusion of covariates.
